My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
1. Hit Target GPA: Attend every class and review notes within 24 hours of the lecture.

2. Learn One Hard Skill: Complete a certification for a technical tool (e.g., Excel, Python, Adobe) relevant to your major.

3. Build a Network: Visit professor office hours twice a semester and join one academic club.

4. Master "Deep Work": Use calendar time-blocking for studying and keep the phone in another room.

5. Protect Your Health: Commit to 7–8 hours of sleep and exercise 3 times a week to prevent burnout.
